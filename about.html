        <h1 id="header">Our Journey.</h1>
        <p>Paywise originated in 1989 with the commencement of research into salary packaging benefits and operation, which resulted in the exciting development of Paywise’s in-house salary packaging software. The software was operated by individual businesses to model and manage salary packaging savings available to their employees. Car dealerships utilised the software to demonstrate the benefits of packaging to their clients.</p>
        <p>As the industry grew and the legislation / reporting requirements became more complex, Paywise evolved its service to an outsourced business model. Paywise is now becoming a leading player in Salary Packaging, offering a unique service of both salary packaged and non-salary packaged benefits.</p>
